# DONE

done.rb is a script allowing you to track what you've done in a simple way.


# MOTIVATION

Todolists are great but most of the time they only tell you what you have todo
ant not what you've done so far. I wanted a tool that I could use in a terminal
(my terminal is a kind of second home) with a single line and that would store
the things I do everyday in a readable format (YAML). One more requirement is the use
of tags in order to bring a bit of organization in all those messy notes.


# FEATURES
    
    * a single command line
    * notes store in YAML format
    * simple organzation with tags
